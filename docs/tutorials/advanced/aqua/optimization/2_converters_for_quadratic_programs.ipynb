    "## Introduction\n",
    "Qiskit Optimization provides with `QuadraticProgram` a very generic and powerful representation for optimization problems. However, usually, optimization algorithms cannot handle all possible types of problems that can be modelled, but only a sub-class.\n",
    "Many available quantum optimization algorithms can handle Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems.\n",
    "To do so, first, it is necessary to convert a given optimization problem into a QUBO. \n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit Optimization provides converters to achieve this conversion whenever possible.\n",
    "More precisely, Qiskit Optimization provides the following converters:\n",
    "- `InequalityToEquality`: converts inequality constraints into equality constraints with additional slack variables.\n",
    "- `IntegerToBinary`: converts integer variables into binary variables and corresponding coefficients. \n",
    "- `LinearEqualityToPenalty`: convert equality constraints into additional terms of the object function.\n",
    "- `QuadraticProgramToQubo`: a wrapper for `IntegerToBinary` and `LinearEqualityToPenalty` for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit Optimization also provides algorithms and converters that are not based on Ising Hamiltonians, e.g., the `GroverOptimizer`. The algorithm and and the converter of an optimization problem to the required oracle are introduced in a separate tutorial."
