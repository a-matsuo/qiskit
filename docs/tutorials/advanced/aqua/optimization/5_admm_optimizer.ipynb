We first load necessary packages and populate with docplex. 3-ADMM-H needs a QUBO optimizer to solve the QUBO subproblem, and a continuous optimizer to solve the continuous convex constrained subproblem. We first solve the problem classically: a minimum eigensolver optimizer is used as QUBO optimizers, while Cplex is the continuous convex solver. 3-ADMM-H supports any other suitable solver available in Qiskit. For instance, VQE, QAOA, and Grover can be invoked as quantum solvers."
